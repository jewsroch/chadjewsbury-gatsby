A new version of my personal site (in development). I'm playing with Gatsby and some of the plugins/transformers available for it. I hope to have a simple new version of this site live soon.

Pages I plan to add...
- [ ] About Me
- [ ] Articles (blog)
- [ ] Books (pull in from goodreads)
- [ ] Projects (highlight past/pressent projects)
- [ ] Photos (maybe...)
- [ ] Now

This site was started using the default gatsby-starter

For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/).

## Install

Make sure that you have the Gatsby CLI program installed:
```sh
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

And run from your CLI:
```sh
gatsby new gatsby-example-site
```

Then you can run it by:
```sh
cd gatsby-example-site
npm run develop
```

## Deploy
